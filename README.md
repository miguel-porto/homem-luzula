# Luzula - field data collecting app, for species inventories
[Download installation APK here](https://flora-on.pt/app-release.apk)

## Who is this app for?

**Field botanists** who can identify most of the plant species *de visu*.

## What is this app for?

For conducting **floristic surveys** (species inventories) **at high speed**.

## But how?

This app is optimized for **greatly speeding up** and simplifying **field data collection**, in the form of species lists with
species name, abundance, phenological state and other data.

Species are recorded by tapping its **abbreviation (4 letters or less)**. The abbreviation is looked up in the reference
checklist and matching species are displayed for selection. For example, "sarv" will match *Stachys arvensis*,
*Sinapis arvensis*, among a few others, depending on the reference checklist.
Phenological state and uncertainty in identification can be directly specified with one tap.

Further, you can **pin some species in a quick mark toolbar**, so you can record their occurrence (species, date and coordinates)
with a single tap. This is useful when you're conducting a fine scale occurrence map of a few species.

Full offline **GPS navigation over aerial imagery** is integrated, with tracklog recording, and **GIS vector layers can be added**
(e.g. for displaying the limits of the study area, a grid, etc.).

Data is output as a CSV text table, that can easily be uploaded to any database or edited in a spreadsheet. Tracklog is exported in GeoJson format,
compatible with GIS software.

## What is this app not for?

**Not for** identifying species in the field. This app assumes you already know the species that you are inventorying.
This app is for serious field work surveys at high speed.

## Highlights
* Fast inventorying by looking up species short abbreviations
* Fast mark pinned species
* Full GPS navigation over aerial imagery (using [osmdroid](https://github.com/osmdroid/osmdroid))
* Automatically stores aerial imagery for offline use
* Records the tracklog
* Imports vector layers from GIS
* Very easy handling of vector layers
